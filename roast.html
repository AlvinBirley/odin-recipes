        <p1>Description</p1>
        <p2>Red wine pot roast is a one-pot meal that is very easy to make but tastes incredible! 
            The beef is so tender after being braised for several hours; that it melts in your mouth. 
            The red wine sauce is tangy and a little bit sweet with a nice kick to it.</p2>

    <p1>Steps</p1>
    <ol>

        <li class ="top-li">Preheat oven to 375°F. </li>
        
        <li>Heat oil in an oven-proof dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
            Sear the meat on all sides for about 5 minutes each. 
            The meat should be darker with a seared crust.</li>
        
        <li>Tuck the onions around and under the beef and cook for about 5 or so minutes. 
            You'll want them to caramelize a bit. Add the garlic cloves about a minute before the onions are done.</li>
        
        <li>Add the carrots, bay leaves, thyme, stock, and wine.</li>
        
        <li>Cover and bake 2 1/2 hours on 350.</li>

        <li>Add the potatoes and cook another 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>Plate the beef and vegetables. Spoon sauce over and serve.</li>
